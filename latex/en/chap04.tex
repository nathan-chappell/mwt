\chapter{Testing}

In the next sections, the methods used for testing the program described above will be discussed.  It will be convenient to assume that sets representing row vectors and cone-generators do not contain $\0$.  This results in no loss of generality, only the annoyance of constantly assuming some triviality does not occur.

\paragraph{Notation:} Let $AU \leq \b$ be shorthand for $(\forall \u\in U) A\u \leq \b$.

\section{Testing H-Cone $\to$ V-Cone}
Suppose we have an H-Cone $C_A= \HC{A}$, and would like to test if a V-Cone $C_{V'} = \cone(V')$ represents the same set.  It's easy to check that
\[ AV'\leq\0 \Rightarrow C_{V'} \subseteq C_A\]
It's not clear what to do to check if $C_A\subseteq C_{V'}$.  Suppose we had a set $V$, and we knew that $C_A= \cone(V)$, and that $C_A= C_{V'} \Rightarrow V \subseteq V'$.  Then we'd have the following situation:
\begin{alignat*}{2}
	 & AV'\leq\0 \;      & \Rightarrow & \; C_{V'} \subseteq C_A \\
	 & V \subseteq V' \; & \Rightarrow & \; C_A\subseteq C_{V'}  \\
	 & C_{V'} = C_A \;   & \Rightarrow & \; V \subseteq V'       \\
	 & C_{V'} = C_A \;   & \Rightarrow & \; AV'\leq\0
\end{alignat*}

The problem is now to come up with such a set $V$, and to determine when such a set may or may not exist for a given cone.  We will need to relax the requirements on $V$ a little bit, but not in a way that reduces its utility.  First, we consider a \textit{minimal} set generating a cone.

\begin{Def}[Minimal Set]
	A set $V$ is called \textit{minimal} for $\cone(V)$ if
	\[ (\forall \v \in V)\; \cone(V\setminus\{\v\}) \subset \cone(V) \]
\end{Def}

\begin{Prop}\label{v_not_minimal}
	If a set $V$ is not minimal for $\cone(V)$ then
	\[\exists \v\in V,\, \t\geq\0,\, \v=V\e_i,\,\t\neq\e_i:\quad \v = V\t \]
	That is, there is a member of $V$ which is a non-trivial non-negative linear combination of elements of V.
\end{Prop}

\begin{proof}
	Say $\cone(V\setminus\{\v\}) = \cone(V)$ where $\v=V\e_i$.  Then $\exists \t\geq\0$ such that $\v=(V\setminus\{\v\})\t$.  Let $\t'$ be $\t$ with a $0$ in the position corresponding to $\v$ in $V$.  Then $\v=V\t$.
\end{proof}

Is the converse true?  That is, is it true that, if $V$ is minimal, then
\begin{equation}
	\t\geq\0,\,\v=V\e_i,\; [\v=V\t \Rightarrow \t=\e_i]\, \label{vmin_implies}
\end{equation}
Not quite.  There is one catch, if there is some
\begin{equation}
	\t\geq\0,\,\t\neq\0,\,V\t=\0  \label{not_pointed}
\end{equation}
then \eqref{vmin_implies} fails.  So, for what cones does \eqref{not_pointed} fail?  It turns out that there is a useful class of cones called \textit{pointed} having this property.

\begin{Def}[Vertex]
	Let $P$ be a polyhedron.  A point $\v \in P$ is called a \textit{vertex} if, for any $\u \neq \0$, at least one of the following is true:
	\begin{align*}
		\v + \u \not\in P \\
		\v - \u \not\in P
	\end{align*}
\end{Def}

\begin{Def}[Pointed Cones]
	A cone is called \textit{pointed} if it has a vertex.
\end{Def}

\begin{Prop} \label{v_is_pointed} The following statements are equivalent.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\cone(V)$ is pointed.
		\item $\t\geq\0,\,\t\neq\0,\; [V\t=\0 \Rightarrow \t=\0]$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{Prop}

\begin{proof}
	First, observe that, due to \nameref{cone_closure}, if a cone has a vertex, then it is the origin.  Suppose that the origin is a vertex, but that (2) fails.  Since $\0\not\in V$, $\t$ has at least two non-zero elements, let one be $t_i$.  Then $\0 = V(t_i\e_i) + V(\t-t_i\e_i)$.  Let $\u=V(t_i\e_i$.  Clearly $\u\neq\0$, and also $\u,-\u\in C$.  Then the origin is not a vertex, a contradiction.

	Next, suppose that $\0$ is not a vertex, then $\exists\t_1,\t_2\geq\0$, $\t_{1,2}\neq\0$, $\u=V\t_1$, $-\u=V\t_2$.  Then $\t_1+\t_2\geq\0$, $\t_1+\t_2\neq\0$, and $V(\t_1+\t_2)=\0$.
\end{proof}

Now we can consider the converse of \Cref{v_not_minimal}.

\begin{Prop}\label{min_vcone_generators}
	Suppose that $\cone(V)$ is pointed.  Then the following two statements are equivalent:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item V is minimal
		\item $\t\geq\0,\,\v=V\e_i,\; [\v=V\t \Rightarrow \t=\e_i]$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{Prop}

\begin{proof}
	$(\neg 1 \Rightarrow \neg 2)$ is \Cref{v_not_minimal}.  So suppose that $\t\geq\0,\,\v=V\e_i$, and $\v=V\t$.  If $0\leq t_i < 1$, then $\v = V(\t-t_i\e_i)/(1-t_i)$, and $\v\in \cone(V\setminus\{\v\} $, which would mean that $V$ is not minimal.  Suppose that $t_i\geq 1$.  Then $\t-\e_i\geq\0$, and $\0=V(\t-\e_i)$.  Because $V$ is pointed, by \Cref{v_is_pointed} $\0=\t-\e_i$, so $\t=\e_i$.
\end{proof}

\Cref{min_vcone_generators} gives us a way to characterize the minimal sets generating V-Cones.  Clearly, there is not a unique minimal set generating any V-Cone.  However, we can relax the requirement of unicity to equivalence, in the following way.

\begin{Def}[vector equivalence]
	Let $\u,\v \in \R^d$, non-zero, and suppose that $\u/\norm{\u} = \v/\norm{\v}$.  Then say that $\u,\v$ are \textit{equivalent}, and write $\u \simeq \v$.  If for every $\u\in U$ there is a $\v\in V$ such that $\u\simeq\v$, write $ U \sqsubseteq V$.  Write $U \simeq V$ if $U \sqsubseteq V$ and $V \sqsubseteq U$.
\end{Def}

\begin{Prop}\label{vector_equivalence}
	Then the following two statements are equivalent:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\v\simeq\u$
		\item $(\exists t>0)\;\v=t\u$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{Prop}

\begin{proof}
	$(1\Rightarrow 2)$.  Let $t=\norm{\v}/\norm{\u}$.  Then $t>0$, and $\v=t\u$.\\
	$(2\Rightarrow 1)$.  $\v/\norm{\v} = t\u/\norm{t\u} = \u/\norm{\u}$
\end{proof}

We now show that the minimal sets generating pointed V-Cones are essentially unique.

\begin{Prop}[Minimal Generators of a Pointed Cone]\label{min_pointed_generators}
	Suppose that $V$ is minimal, and $\cone(V) = \cone(V')$ is pointed.  Then $V\sqsubseteq V'$.  It follows that if $V'$ is also minimal, then $V\simeq V'$.
\end{Prop}

We'll use this short lemma in the proof of the above proposition.

\begin{Lemma}\label{non_negative_sums_to_e}
	Suppose $A$ is a non-negative matrix, $\b\geq\0$, and $A\b = \e_i$.  Then there exists an $l$, $t>0$ such that $A(t\e_l) = \e_i$
\end{Lemma}

\begin{proof}
	Since $A$ and $\b$ are non-negative, the following holds:
	\begin{align}
		%&(\forall j,k\neq i)\; A_k^j > 0 \Rightarrow b_j = 0 \label{Ajk_neq_0}\\
		 & (\forall j,k\neq i)\; b_j   > 0 \Rightarrow A_k^j = 0 \label{bk_neq_0}
	\end{align}
	Since $A\b=\e_i$, there is some $b_l > 0$, and $A_k^l > 0$.  \eqref{bk_neq_0} shows that the entire column is zero except for the entry in row $i$, so $A(\e_l/A_k^l) = \e_i$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of \Cref{min_pointed_generators}]
	Let $\v\in V$, $\v=V\e_i$.  If we can show that there is some $\v'\in V'$ such that $\v\simeq\v'$, then we're done.  Since $\cone(V)=\cone(V')$, there is a non-negative matrix $A$ such that $V'=VA$.  Furthermore, there is a non-negative vector $\b$ such that $\v=V'\b$.  Then $\v=V'\b=(VA)\b=V(A\b)$.  By \Cref{min_vcone_generators}, $A\b=\e_i$.  By \Cref{non_negative_sums_to_e}, there is a $t>0,l$ such that $A\b=A(t\e_l)$.  Then $\v=VA(t\e_l)=tV'\e_l=t\v'$ where $\v'\in V'$.  By \Cref{vector_equivalence}, $\v\simeq\v'$.
\end{proof}

So now we know that pointed cones have essentially unique generating sets.  We now turn to the question of using this knowledge to create a test for the program.  We suppose that we have a minimal generating set $V$ for some pointed V-Cone $C$, and have created a matrix $A$ so that $C = \HC{A} = \cone(V)$.  We run the program and get a set $V'$, and let $C'=\cone(V')$.  We must check that $C' = C$.
\begin{alignat*}{2}
	 & AV'\leq\0 \;        & \Rightarrow & \; C' \subseteq C   \\
	 & V \sqsubseteq V' \; & \Rightarrow & \; C \subseteq C'   \\
	 & C' = C \;           & \Rightarrow & \; V \sqsubseteq V' \\
	 & C' = C \;           & \Rightarrow & \; AV'\leq\0
\end{alignat*}

\begin{EqCriteria}[H-Cone $\to$ V-Cone]\label{eq_hc_vc}
	Say $V$ is a minimal generating set for the pointed V-Cone $C$, and suppose $C = \HC{A} = \cone(V)$.  Then
	\[ C = \cone(V') \;\Leftrightarrow\; AV'\leq\0,\, V \sqsubseteq V' \]
\end{EqCriteria}

\begin{Test}[H-Cone $\to$ V-Cone]\label{test_hc_to_vc}
	We now have a method for testing the program.  First, we hand-craft an H-Cone $\HC{A}$ based on minimal set $V$ for some pointed V-Cone. We then run our program to get a set $V'$, with the alleged property that $\cone(V') = \HC{A}$.  If we confirm \Cref{eq_hc_vc}, then our program has succeeded.
\end{Test}

\begin{Remark}
	Can we test the program for non-pointed cones?  Yes, but it is slightly more complicated.  Instead of prior knowledge of a minimal generating set for the cone, we also need to know what the largest linear subspace $L$ contained in the cone.  If we project away this linear subspace, then we will have a pointed cone.  Given another set $V'$, we may project away this subspace from $V'$ using a projection matrix, and use \Cref{test_hc_to_vc}.  Then we need to see if $\cone(V')$ spans $L$.  This can be done with a modified fourier-motzkin elimination, but unfortunately we are trying to test the implementation of fourier-motzkin elimination.

	It may still be worthwhile to do such tests, but it should be noted that a test isn't designed to prove a program correct, only prove it incorrect.  If we analyze the program well and test the fourier-motzkin elimination extensively, then the added complexity of the more general testing may not be worth it.  As of now this is left as a possible future extension of the program.
\end{Remark}

\begin{Remark}
	While not important for testing the program, one may ask if pointed V-Cones are the only cones with essentially unique generating sets.  The answer is no, for any line has an essentially unique generating set, but is not pointed.  However, this is the only exception.  It isn't hard to see that, given a non-pointed cone, if it occupies more than one-dimension, then it must at least occupy a half-plane, and a halfplane has uncountably many non-equivalent generators.  So, technically, the \Cref{test_hc_to_vc} would work for one-dimensional non-pointed cones (lines).
\end{Remark}

\section{Testing V-Cone $\to$ H-Cone}

In this section we create a method in the vein of \nameref{test_hc_to_vc}, but for testing the program transforming V-Cones to H-Cones.  This section is almost identical to the previous, with the exception of requiring the Farkas Lemma.

\begin{Def}[Minimal Set]
	A set $A$ is called \textit{minimal} for $\HC{A}$ if
	\[ (\forall A_i \in A)\; \HC{A\setminus\set{A_i}} \supset \HC{A} \]
\end{Def}

\begin{Prop}\label{a_not_minimal}
	If a set $A$ is not minimal for $\HC{A}$ then
	\[\exists A_i\in A,\, \t\geq\0,\, A_i=\e_i^T A,\,\t\neq\e_i:\quad A_i = \t^T V \]
	That is, there is a member of $A$ which is a non-trivial non-negative linear combination of elements of V.
\end{Prop}

In order to prove \Cref{a_not_minimal}, we require the Farkas Lemma.

\subsection{Farkas Lemma}

\begin{Prop}[The Farkas Lemma]\label{farkas_lemma}
	Let $U \in \R^{d\times n}$.  Precisely one of the following is true:
	\begin{align*}
		 & (\exists \t \geq \0) : \x = U\t                \\
		 & (\exists \y) : U^T\y \leq 0,\; \ip{\x}{\y} > 0
	\end{align*}
\end{Prop}

\begin{proof}  That both can't be true can be seen by:
	\[ \x = U\t \quad\Rightarrow\quad \y^T\x = \y^T U\t \quad\Rightarrow\quad 0 \neq 0 \]
	To see that at least one is true we must reconsider the process of converting a V-Cone to an H-Cone.  First, from $\cone(U)$ we create the following matrix:
	\[ A = \begin{pmatrix*}[r] \0 & -I \\ I & -U \\ -I & U \end{pmatrix*}  \]
	By the way $A$ is constructed,
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:flcone}
		(\exists \t) : A \xt \leq \0 \Leftrightarrow (\exists \t\geq\0)\; \x = U\t
	\end{equation}
	In the proof of the transformation, we use \Nameref{fm_hcone} to transform that matrix $A$.  The \Nameref{fm_matrix} promises a sequence of matrices $Y_{d+1}, \dots, Y_{d+n}$ with certain properties.  Let $Y = (Y_{d+n})(Y_{d+(n-1)})\dots(Y_{d+1})$, then it can be said of $Y$:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Every element of $Y$ is non-negative.
		\item $Y$ is finite.
		\item The last $n$ columns of $YA$ are all $\0$.
		\item \((\exists t_{d+1},\dots,t_{d+n})A(\x + \sum_{i=d+1}^{d+n} t_i\e_i) \leq \0
		      \Leftrightarrow (YA)\x \leq \0 \)
	\end{enumerate}
	Note that here $\x \in \R^{d+n}$.  $A$ has three blocks of rows, which can be labeled with $Z,P,N$ in a fairly obvious way.  Then, $Y$ can be broken up into three blocks of columns, so that
	\[ Y = (Y_Z \; Y_P \; Y_N) \]
	Where each of $Y_Z,Y_P,Y_N \geq \0$.  Consolidating what is known about $A$ and $Y$,
	\[ YA = (Y_Z \; Y_P \; Y_N) \begin{pmatrix*}[r] \0 & -I \\ I & -U \\ -I & U \end{pmatrix*}
		= (Y' \; \0) \]
	Here, we have let $Y' = Y_P - Y_N$.  Then it follows that
	\[ \0 = -Y_Z - Y_P(U) + Y_N(U) = -Y_Z - Y'(U) \;\Rightarrow\; Y_Z = - Y'U
		\;\Rightarrow\; Y'U \leq \0 \]
	Then it holds that, for any row $\y' \in Y'$:
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:flneg}
		\y'U \leq \0
	\end{equation}
	It is also true that
	\[ (YA)\xt = (Y'\;\0)\xt = Y'\x \]
	We also have
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:flconst}
		(\exists \t) : A \xt \leq \0 \Leftrightarrow
		(YA)\xt \leq \0 \Leftrightarrow
		Y'\x \leq \0
	\end{equation}
	Note that here $\x \in \R^d$.  So, if given some $\x$, the left side of \eqref{eq:flconst} is not satisfied, then neither is the right, and there must be some row $\y' \in Y'$ such that the following holds:
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:flconstbrk} \ip{\y'}{\x} > 0 \end{equation}
	Then we conclude that, if the right side of \eqref{eq:flcone} fails, then there is a vector $\y' \in Y'$ satisfying \eqref{eq:flneg} and \eqref{eq:flconstbrk}.
\end{proof}

\begin{Remark}\label{valid_cone_ineq}
	\nameref{farkas_lemma} above can be equivalently stated:
	\[ (\exists \t \geq \0) : \t^T A = \y \quad\Leftrightarrow\quad
		\neg(\exists \x) : A\x \leq 0,\; \ip{\y}{\x} > 0 \]
	This way of writing it makes it clear that, if $\y^T\x\leq 0$ holds for some H-Cone $\HC{A}$, then $\y$ is a non-negative linear combination of the rows of $A$.
\end{Remark}

\hrule

\begin{proof}[Proof of \Cref{a_not_minimal}]
	Say $\HC{(A\setminus\{A_i\})} = \HC{A}$.  Then, by \Cref{valid_cone_ineq}, $A_i^T\x\leq 0$ holds for $\HC{(A\setminus\{A_i\})} = \HC{A}$, so $A_i$ is a non-negative linear combination of some rows of $A\setminus\{A_i\}$.
\end{proof}

As before, the converse will fail if we can combine rows of $A$ in a non-trivial way to get $\0$.  For what cones does this occur?  Well, it would be necessary that the following holds for some $\y$:
\[ \y^T\x \leq 0,\quad -\y^T\x\leq 0 \]
But this means that $\y^T\x = 0$ holds for every member of the cone.  We can prevent this from occuring by forcing the cone to contain a basis.

\begin{Def}[Full-Dimensional Cones]
	A cone is called \textit{full-dimensional} if it contains a basis (i.e. $d$ linearly-independent vectors).
\end{Def}

The most important property of a basis $B$ that we shall use is:
\begin{equation}
	\y^T B = \0 \Rightarrow \y = \0 \label{basis_li}
\end{equation}

\begin{Prop} \label{a_full_d}The following statements are equivalent.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\HC{A}$ is full-dimensional.
		\item $\t\geq\0,\,\t\neq\0,\; [\t^T A=\0 \Rightarrow \t=\0]$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{Prop}

\begin{proof}
	$(\neg 1\Rightarrow \neg 2)$.  If $\HC{A}$ is not full-dimensional, then there is some $\y$ so that for every $\x$ the cone $\y^T\x= 0$.  Then, by \Cref{valid_cone_ineq}, we'd have some non-negative $\t_1,\t_2$ such that $\t_1^T A = \y$ and $\t_2^T A = -\y$, in which case $\t_1 + \t_2$ is a counter example to $(2)$.

	$(\neg 2\Rightarrow \neg 1)$.  Suppose $\t\geq\0$, $\t^T A =\0$, and $\t\neq\0$.  Since $\0\not\in A$, at least two elements of $\y$ are non-zero, say one is $y_i$.  Then $\0 = y_i A_i + (\y-y_i\e_i)^T A$, which then means both $A_i\x\leq 0$ and $-A_i\x\leq 0$ holds for $\HC{A}$, in which case it is not full dimensional.
\end{proof}

\begin{Prop}\label{min_hcone_generators}
	Suppose that $\HC{A}$ is full-dimensional.  Then the following two statements are equivalent:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item A is minimal
		\item $\t\geq\0,\; [A_i=\t^T A \Rightarrow \t=\e_i]$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{Prop}

\begin{proof}
	$(\neg 1 \Rightarrow \neg 2)$ is \Cref{a_not_minimal}.  So suppose that $\t\geq\0$, and $A_i=\t^T A$.  If $0\leq t_i < 1$, then $A_i = (\t-t_i\e_i)^T A/(1-t_i)$, and $\HC{A}=\HC{(A\setminus\set{A_I})}$, which would mean that $A$ is not minimal.  Suppose that $t_i\geq 1$.  Then $\t-\e_i\geq\0$, and $\0=(\t-\e_i)^TA$.  Because $A$ is full-dimensional, by \Cref{a_full_d}, $\0=\t-\e_i$, so $\t=\e_i$.
\end{proof}

\begin{Prop}\label{min_hcones_vcones}
	The following two statements are equivalent:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\HC{A}$ is full dimensional and $A$ is minimal
		\item $\cone(A^T)$ is pointed and $A$ is minimal
	\end{enumerate}
\end{Prop}

\begin{proof}
	This follows from the nearly identical form of $(2)$ in \Cref{min_hcone_generators} and \Cref{min_vcone_generators}.
\end{proof}

In order to create an equivalence criterion like \nameref{eq_hc_vc}, we use the following result.

\begin{Thm}[Dual Cone]\label{dual_cone}
	\[ \HC{A} = \HC{A'} \Leftrightarrow \cone(A^T) = \cone(A'^T) \]
\end{Thm}

\begin{proof}
	First suppose that $\cone(A^T) = \cone(A'^T)$.  Then there exists a non-negative matrix $B$ such that $A'^T = A^TB$.  Then $A\x \leq \0 \Rightarrow B^TA\x\leq \0 \Rightarrow A'\x\leq\0$.  Precisely the same reasoning shows that $A'\x\leq\0 \Rightarrow A\x\leq\0$, and we conclude that $\cone(A^T) = \cone(A'^T) \Rightarrow \HC{A} = \HC{A'}$.

	Next suppose that $\cone(A^T) \neq \cone(A'^T)$, that is, let $\z \in \cone(A^T), \z \not\in\cone(A'^T)$.  We must show that $\HC{A} \neq \HC{A'}$.  By the Farkas Lemma, we have a $\y$ such that $\ip{\y}{\z} > 0,\; A'\y \leq \0$.  Clearly this means that $\y \in \HC{A'}$.  Since $\z \in \cone(A)$, there is some $(\t \geq \0): \z^T = \t^T A$.  Then if $A\y\leq\0$, we would have $\ip{\y}{\z} = \t^T A\y \leq 0 < \ip{\y}{\z}$, a contradiction.  So we conclude that $\y\not\in\HC{A}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{Prop}\label{min_full_dim_generators}
	Suppose that $A$ is minimal, and $\HC{A} = \HC{A'}$ is full-dimensional.  Then $A\sqsubseteq A'$.  It follows that if $A'$ is also minimal, then $A\simeq A'$.
\end{Prop}

\begin{proof}
	By \Cref{min_hcones_vcones} and \Cref{dual_cone}, \Cref{min_full_dim_generators} is true if it is true for cones, which is shown in \nameref{min_pointed_generators}.
\end{proof}

Say we know that $C = \HC{A} = \cone(V)$ is full-dimensional, with $A$ minimal.  We have another set $A'$ and let $C' = \HC{A'}$.  Then we can test if $C' = C$.  The following summarizes the situation:
\begin{alignat*}{2}
	 & A'V\leq\0 \;        & \Rightarrow & \; C \subseteq C'   \\
	 & V \sqsubseteq V' \; & \Rightarrow & \; C'\subseteq C    \\
	 & C' = C \;           & \Rightarrow & \; A \sqsubseteq A' \\
	 & C' = C \;           & \Rightarrow & \; A'V\leq\0
\end{alignat*}

\begin{EqCriteria}[V-Cone $\to$ H-Cone]\label{eq_vc_hc}
	Say $H$ is a minimal generating set of constraints for the full-dimensional H-Cone $C$, and suppose $C = \cone(V) = \HC{A}$.  Then
	\[ C = \HC{A'} \;\Leftrightarrow\; A'V\leq\0,\, A \sqsubseteq A' \]
\end{EqCriteria}

\begin{Test}[H-Cone $\to$ V-Cone]\label{test_vc_to_hc}
	We now have a method for testing the program.  First, we hand-craft a V-Cone $\cone(V)$ based on minimal set $A$ for some pointed H-Cone. We then run our program to get a set $A'$, with the alleged property that $\cone(V) = \HC{A'}$.  If we confirm \Cref{eq_vc_hc}, then our program has succeeded.
\end{Test}

\begin{Remark}
	Can we test the program for non-full-dimensional cones?  (TODO finish this remark).
  %Yes, but again, it is slightly more complicated.  Instead of prior knowledge of a minimal generating of constraints set for the cone, we also need to know what the largest set of independent constraints $B$ such that $B\x=\0$ is valid for the cone.  If we project away constraints from $A$ not orthogonal to all members of $B$, then we will have a pointed cone.  This can be done with a modified fourier-motzkin elimination.  Given another set $A'$, we may project away this subspace from $V'$ using a projection matrix, and use \Cref{test_hc_to_vc}.  Then we need to see if $\cone(V')$ spans $L$.  This can be done with a modified fourier-motzkin elimination, but unfortunately we are trying to test the implementation of fourier-motzkin elimination.

	As of now this is left as a possible future extension of the program.
\end{Remark}

\begin{Remark}
	While not important for testing the program, one may ask if full-dimensional H-Cones are the only cones with essentially unique generating setsof constraints .  The answer is no, for any set of the form $\y^T \x = c$ has an essentially unique generating of constraints.  However, this is the only exception.  It isn't hard to see that, given indpendent constraints of the form $A\x=\0$, if $A$ has more than two rows, then, for any non-singular $B$, $BA\x=\0$ is an equivalent constraint.

\section{Testing H-Polyhedron $\to$ V-Polyhedron}

Say we have an H-Polyhedron $P_{A,\b} = \HP{A}{\b}$, and wish to check that our program correctly calculates a $V'$ and $U'$ such that $P_{A,\b} = \VP{U'}{V'}$.  Again, we shall use the notion of minimality and show that under certain circumstances we can use minimal sets to demonstrate the validity of our algorithm.  In this case, the definition of minimal is a little more complicated, but it asserts that a set $U$ is minimal as before, and that no element of another set $V$ can be expressed as a non-trival sum of a convex combination of $V$ and a non-negative linear combination of members of $U$.

\subsection{Minimal V-Polyhedra Pairs}
\begin{Def}[Minimal Pair]{ A pair of sets $U\in\R^{d\times n}, V\in\R^{d\times p}$ is called an \textit{minimal pair} if for any $\u = U\e_k, \v = V\e_l$ the following is true:
		\begin{alignat*}{1}
			 & \t \geq \0,\; \u = U\t \Rightarrow \t = \e_k                              \\
			 & \t \geq \0, \blambda \geq \0, \ip{\blambda}{\1} = 1, \v = U\t + V\blambda
			\Rightarrow \t = \0, \blambda = \e_l
		\end{alignat*}
	}\end{Def}

Let us now consider the set $U$ in the expression $\HP{A}{b} = \VP{U}{V}$.

\begin{Prop}[Characterstic Cone]\label{characteristic_cone}
	Suppose that $P = \HP{A}{b} = \VP{U}{V}$.  Then
	\[ \cone(U) = \HC{A} \]
\end{Prop}

\begin{proof}
	We show that the following three statements are equivalent:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $A\r\leq\0$
		\item $(\forall \x\in P)(\forall \alpha > 0)\;\x + \alpha\r \in P$
		\item $\r \in \cone(U)$
	\end{enumerate}
	$(1 \Rightarrow 2)$. $\x\in P$ means that $A\x\leq\b$, and $A\r\leq\0$ means that $A(\x+\alpha\r) \leq A\x \leq \b$.\\
	$(\neg 1 \Rightarrow \neg 2)$.  Suppose $\ip{A_i}{\r} > 0$, then let $\alpha > (b_i - \ip{A_i}{\x})/\ip{A_i}{\r}$.  We have:
	\[ \ip{A_i}{\x + \alpha\r} > \ip{A_i}{\x} +
		\frac{b_i\ip{A_i}{\r} - \ip{A_i}{\x}\ip{A_i}{\r}}{\ip{A_i}{\r}} = b_i \]
	$(3 \Rightarrow 2)$.  This is essentially the definition of $\VP{U}{V}$.\\
	$(2 \Rightarrow 3)$.  Now for the real work.  Suppose that (2) holds, but $\r\not\in\cone(U)$.  Then by the Farkas Lemma, we have a $\y$ that satisfies $(\forall \r\in U)\,\ip{\r}{\y}\leq 0,\; \ip{\y}{\r} > 0$.  From (2) we construct a sequence: $(\x_n) = \v+n\cdot\r$.  Then it is clear that the sequence $\ip{\y}{\x_n} \to \infty$.  It is also clear that $(\forall n)\,\x_n \in P$.  We now need the following:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A linear, real-valued function on the set $\conv(V)$ achieves its maximal value at some $\bar\v \in V$.
	\end{itemize}
	To see this is true, suppose that the linear function is given by $\ip{\y}{\cdot}$, and that $\bar\v$ is an element of $V$ such that $(\forall \v \in V)\,\ip{\y}{\bar\v} \geq \ip{\y}{\v}$.  Then, for any $\r \in \conv(V)$, $\r = \sum_{\v\in V} \lambda_v\v$ where $\sum \lambda_v = 1 \Rightarrow \lambda_v \leq 1$, and it follows
	\[\ip{\y}{\r} = \ip{\y}{\sum_{\v\in V}\lambda_v v} = \sum_{v\in V} \lambda_v\ip{\y}{\v}
		\leq \sum_{v\in V}\lambda_v\ip{\y}{\bar\v} = \ip{\y}{\bar\v} \]
	Now consider the maximum value of the function $\ip{\y}{\cdot}$ on $P$.  Since any element of $P$ can be written $\r + \v \st \r\in\cone(U),\,\v\in\conv(V)$, and $(\forall\r\in U) \ip{\y}{\r} \leq 0$, we can find the maximum value on $\conv(V)$.  However, $\ip{\y}{\cdot}$ achievs its maximal value on $\conv(V)$ at some $\bar\v\in V$, which is a contradiction with the fact that $\ip{\y}{\x_n} \to \infty$, so we conclude that $\r\in\cone(U)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{Remark}[Characteristic Cone]\label{characteristic_cone}  Note that $(2)$ in the proof above is independent of $A$ and $U$.  This means that the cone of a polyhedron is independent of its representation, i.e. if $\VP{U}{V} = \VP{U'}{V'}$, then $\cone(U) = \cone(U')$, while it is not necessarily true that $\conv(V) = \conv(V')$.  Similarly, if $\HP{A}{\b} = \HP{A'}{\b'}$, the it holds that $\HC{A} = \HC{A'}$.
\end{Remark}

\begin{Prop}\label{conv_conv}
	A convex combination of convex combinations is another convex combination
\end{Prop}
\begin{proof}
	Let $\Lambda$ represent a collection of convex combinations, that is, $\vec{1}^T\Lambda = \vec{1}^T$, and let $\blambda\geq\0,\,\1^T\blambda = 1$ be a convex combinator.  Then $\Lambda\blambda = \blambda'$ where $\blambda'\geq\0,\,\1^T\blambda'=1$.  That $\blambda'\geq\0$ is clear, then just note that $\1^T\blambda' = \1^T\Lambda\blambda = \1^T\blambda = 1$.
\end{proof}

\begin{Prop}[Minkowski Sums]\label{minkowski_formula}
	The following two statements hold
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $A \subseteq B, C\subseteq D \Rightarrow A + C \subseteq B + D$
		\item $P + \cone(U) + \cone(U) = P + \cone(U)$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{Prop}

\begin{proof}
	(1) $a\in A \Rightarrow a\in B,\; c\in C\Rightarrow c\in D$.  Taken together, $a+c \in B+D$.\\
	(2) $\t,\t'\geq\0 \Rightarrow p + U\t + U\t' = p + U(\t+\t') = p + U\t'', \t''\geq\0$.
\end{proof}

\begin{EqCriteria}\label{eq_hp_vp}
	Suppose that there is an minimal pair $U,V$ such that $P_{A,\b} = \HP{A}{b} = \VP{U}{V}$.  Then the following are equivalent:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $P_{A,\b} = \VP{U'}{V'}$
		\item $U \sqsubseteq U',\; V \subseteq V',\; AU'\leq\0,\, AV'\leq\b$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{EqCriteria}

\begin{proof}
	$(2 \Rightarrow 1)$.  There's not too much to say about this direction, it's mostly just collecting some straightforward observations and results.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[(a)] $U \sqsubseteq U' \Rightarrow \cone(U) \subseteq \cone(U')$
		\item[(b)] $V \subseteq V' \Rightarrow \conv(V) \subseteq \conv(V')$
		\item[(c)] (a) + (b) $\Rightarrow P_{A,\b} \subseteq \VP{U'}{V'}$
		\item[(d)] $AU'\leq\0 \Rightarrow \cone(U') \subseteq \cone(U)$
		\item[(e)] $AV'\leq\b \Rightarrow \conv(V') \subseteq P_{A,\b}$
		\item[(f)] (d) + (e) $\Rightarrow \VP{U'}{V'} \subseteq P_{A,\b} + \cone(U) = P_{A,\b}$
		\item (c) + (f) $\Rightarrow (2 \Rightarrow 1)$
	\end{itemize}
	(a) and (b) are clear, (c) uses \Cref{minkowski_formula}, (d) requires \nameref{characteristic_cone}, (e) is clear, and (f) uses \Cref{minkowski_formula}.

	$(1 \Rightarrow 2)$.  This direction is a little more interesting.  First we observe:
	\[ \cone(U) = \HC{A} = \cone(U') \Rightarrow U \sqsubseteq U' \]
	The equalities follow from \nameref{characteristic_cone}, and the implication follows from \Cref{eq_hc_vc}.  Note that the minimality of $U$ and the Farkas lemma are both used here.  Since we know that $\cone(U) = \cone(U')$, we also know that $\VP{U'}{V'} = \VP{U}{V'}$.  Next, we consider $V$ and exploit its minimality.  Since $P_{A,\b} = \VP{U}{V'}$, each $\v'\in V'$ can be written $U\t + V\blambda$, where $\t \geq \0$ and $\blambda$ is a convex combinator.  We combine these into matrices $T$ and $\Lambda$, so $V' = UT + V\Lambda$.  But it is also true that every $\v\in V$ can be written as
	\[ \v = U\t + V'\blambda = U\t + (UT + V\Lambda)\blambda = U\t' + V\blambda' \]
	Where $\t'\geq\0$, and $\blambda'$ is a convex combinator.  Because $U,V$ is an minimal pair, we have that $\t'=\0$, and $\blambda = \e_k$ for some $k$.  Because $U$ is minimal, it does not contain $\0$, and so $\t = \0$.  This puts us at $\v = V'\blambda = V\Lambda\blambda = V\blambda'$, and $\blambda' = \e_k$.  In order that $\blambda' = \e_k$, for every column of $\Lambda$ corresponding to a positive entry in $\blambda$, only one row may contain a positive entry, and that entry must be $1$.  Then instead of $\blambda$, use instead $\e_l$ where $\Lambda_k^l = 1$.  Then $\Lambda\blambda = \Lambda\e_l$, so $V\Lambda\blambda = V\Lambda\e_l = V'\e_l=\v'$ where $\v'\in V'$.  Then $\v \in V'$.

	That $AV'\leq\b$ is obvious, and that $AU'\leq\0$ is mentioned in the remarks after \Cref{characteristic_cone}.
\end{proof}

\begin{Test}[H-Polyhedron $\to$ V-Polyhedron]\label{test_hp_to_vp}
	We now have a method for testing the program.  First, we hand-craft an H-Polyhedron $\HP{A}{\b}$ based on some minimal pair $(U,V)$, then run our program to get the pair $(U',V')$, with the alleged property that $\HP{A}{\b} = \VP{U'}{V'}$.  If we confirm \Cref{eq_hp_vp}, then our program has succeeded.
\end{Test}

\section{Testing V-Polyhedron $\to$ H-Polyhedron}
Now we suppose we have a V-Polyhedron $P_{U,V} = \VP{U}{V}$, and would like to test the program which returns a matrix-vector pair $A',\b'$ where supposedly $P_{U,V} = \HP{A'}{\b'}$.  Again, we will start off with a pair $A,\b$ where we know that $P_{U,V} = \HP{A}{\b}$, where $A,\b$ satisfy some nice properties, and use those properties to test if $P_{U,V} = \HP{A'}{\b'}$.  In order to demonstrate these properties, the Farkas Lemma will be used, but in different forms.  We want to use \Cref{eq_vc_hc}, but first we have to check:

\begin{Prop}\label{homogenization_cone}
	The following statements are equivalent:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\HP{A}{\b} = \HP{A'}{\b'}$
		\item $\set{\xx \big| \pmb -1 & \0 \\ -\b & A \pme \xx \leq \0} =
			      \set{\xx \big| \pmb -1 & \0 \\ -\b' & A' \pme \xx \leq \0}$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{Prop}

\begin{proof}
	$(2 \Rightarrow 1)$.  Just set $x_0 = 1$, and move $\b,\b'$ to the right side of the inequalities.
	$(\neg 2 \Rightarrow \neg 1)$.  Suppose that:
	\[ \pmb -1 & \0 \\ -\b & A \pme \xx \leq \0,\quad
		\pmb -1 & \0 \\ -\b' & A' \pme \xx \not\leq \0 \]
	Observe that, by the way these sets are constructed, $x_0 \geq 0$.  If $x_0 = 0$, then we have $\HC{A} \neq \HC{A'}$, which, by the remark following \Cref{characteristic_cone} means that $\HP{A}{\b} \neq \HP{A'}{\b'}$.  If $x_0 > 0$, then we have:
	\[ A\x \leq x_0\b,\;A'\x\not\leq x_0\b' \Rightarrow A(\x/x_0)\leq\b,\;A'(\x/x_0)\not\leq\b' \]
	So $\HP{A}{\b} \neq \HP{A'}{\b'}$.
\end{proof}

Now, combining the results of \Nameref{characteristic_cone} and \cref{homogenization_cone}, we have the following result:

\begin{Prop}\label{dual_homogenization_cone}
	The following two statement are equivalent:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\HP{A}{\b} = \HP{A'}{\b'}$
		\item $\cone \pmb -\b^T & -1 \\ A^T & \0 \pme = \cone \pmb -\b'^T & -1 \\ A'^T & \0 \pme$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{Prop}
%\begin{proof} This immediately follows from propositions \ref{homogenization_cone} and \ref{dual cone}.  \end{proof}

\subsection{Minimal H-Polyhedra Pairs}
\begin{Def}[Minimal Pair]{\label{min_hpair}
		A pair $A,\b$ is called \textbf{minimal} if $\HP{A}{\b}$ is non-empty, and
		\begin{align*}
			 & \t \geq \0,\, \t^T A = A_i \Rightarrow \t^T b \geq b_i                             \\
			 & \t \geq \0,\, \t^T(A,b) = (A_i,b_i) \Rightarrow [\t \neq \0 \Rightarrow \t = \e_i] \\
		\end{align*}
	}\end{Def}

Of course, we want to say that if $P = \HP{A}{\b}$ where $(A,\b)$ is an minimal pair, and $P = \HP{A'}{\b'}$, then, by \Cref{dual_homogenization_cone}, $(A,\b) \sqsubseteq (A',\b')$.  The catch is that the cones in \Cref{dual_homogenization_cone} have a strange form.  What we want to be true turns out to be so, but before we can prove this fact, we need a property of minimal pairs, which requires a new form of the Farkas Lemma.

\subsection{Farkas Lemma: Round 2}

Let us restate the conclusion of the Farkas Lemma:
\newcommand{\xor}{\;\Leftrightarrow\;\neg}
\[ \exists \t\geq\0 \st U\t = \x \xor \exists \y\st \y^TU\leq\0,\, \y^T\x > 0 \]
If we let $U = (A,-A,I)$, and  we get a new form:
\[ \exists \t \geq\0 \st (A,-A,I)\t = \x \xor \exists \y\st \y^T(A,-A,I)\leq\0,\, \y^T\x > 0 \]
Then breaking apart $\t = (\t_P,\t_N,\t_I)$, we have
\[ (A,-A,I)\pmb \t_P\\ \t_N\\ \t_I \pme = \x \Rightarrow A(\t_P - \t_N) = \x - \t_I \]
If we let $\t_P - \t_N = \z$, then $\z$ is no longer constrained by $\t \geq\0$, and we have that $A\z \leq \x$.  Since $\y^T A \leq \0$ and $-\y^T A\leq \0$, it must be that $\y^T A = \0$.  Combining these results, relabeling $\x$ as $\b$ and $\z$ as $\x$, and $\y$ as $-\y$, we see a new form of Farkas Lemma:
\begin{Thm}[Farkas Lemma 2]\label{FL2}
	\[ \exists \x \st A\x \leq \b \xor \exists \y\geq\0 \st \y^TA = \0,\, \y^T\b < 0 \]
\end{Thm}
This form tells us that an H-Polyhedron is non-empty, or we can create an inequality that is impossible to solve from it's matrix.  The next form shows a similar result, but this time it is for a specific $\x$, not implying the emptyness of the Polyhedra, just the constraints' failure to be satisfied at a specific point.
%
%First observe that (using \eqref{FL2})
%\[ A\x \not\leq \b \Leftrightarrow \neg \exists \z\st
%	\pmb A\\I\\-I\pme \z \leq \pmb \b\\ \x\\ -\x \pme \Leftrightarrow
%	\exists \y\geq\0\st \y^T\pmb A\\I\\-I\pme =\0,\, \y^T\pmb \b\\ \x\\ -\x \pme < 0\]
%Splitting up $\y$ into components like we did before with $\t$, we can rewrite this as
%
%\begin{equation} \label{eq:FL3}
%	A\x \not\leq \b \Leftrightarrow \exists \y\st \y^T A = \w,\, \y^T \b < \w^T\b
%\end{equation}

We can now prove some useful properties of minimal pairs.

\begin{Prop}\label{minimal_Ab_pair_properties}
	Let $A,\b$ be an minimal pair.  Then the following holds:
	\begin{alignat*}{6}
		\t\geq\0,\,\t^T A \, & = & \, \0  \, & \Rightarrow & \, [\t & \neq & \, \0 \,   & \Rightarrow & \, \ip{\t}{\b} \, & > & \, 0 ]   \\
		\t\geq\0,\,\t^T A \, & = & \, A_i \, & \Rightarrow & \, [\t & \neq & \, \e_i \, & \Rightarrow & \, \ip{\t}{\b} \, & > & \, b_i ]
	\end{alignat*}
\end{Prop}

\begin{proof}
	Suppose that $\t^T A = \0,\, \t\neq\0$.  Next suppose that $\ip{\t}{\b} = 0$.  Then $(\t + \e_i)(A,b) = (A_i,b_i)$, but $\t+\e_i \neq \e_i$, a contradiction.  Next suppose that ${\ip{\t}{\b} < 0}$.  Then we have that $\exists \t\geq\0,\,\t^T A = \0,\,\t^T \b < 0$, which by \nameref{FL2} means that $\HP{A}{b}$ is empty, but minimal pairs do not represent empy polyhedra.  So the first property is proven.

	Now suppose that $\t^T A = A_i, \t\neq\e_i$.  Then by \Cref{min_hpair} we know that $\t^T \b \geq b_i$, so say $\ip{\t}{\b} = 0$.  If $t_i\geq 1$, then $\t-\e_i\geq \0$, and
	\[(\t - \e_i)^T A = \0, (\t-\e_i)^T\b < 0\]
	contradicting the first property.  Otherwise $0\leq t_i < 1$, so let $\t' = (\t-t_i\e_i)/(1-t_i)$.  Then $\t'^T A = A_i$, and $\t'^T\b = 0$, again contradicting the first property.
\end{proof}

We are now prepared to prove the following proposition.

\begin{Prop}\label{minimal_Ab}
	Suppose that $\HP{A}{\b} = \HP{A'}{\b'}$, where $(A,\b)$ is an minimal pair.  Then $(A,\b) \sqsubseteq (A',\b')$.
\end{Prop}

\begin{proof}
	It suffices to show that $\pmb -\b^T & -1 \\ A^T & \0 \pme$ is minimal, for then:
	\[\pmb -\b^T & -1 \\ A^T & \0 \pme \sqsubseteq \pmb -\b'^T & -1 \\ A'^T & \0 \pme \Rightarrow
		\pmb -\b^T \\ A^T \pme \sqsubseteq \pmb -\b'^T \\ A'^T \pme \Rightarrow
		(A,\b) \sqsubseteq (A',\b')
	\]
	So, suppose that $(\t,t) \geq \0$, $\pmb -\b^T & -1 \\ A^T & \0 \pme(\t,t) = \pmb -b_i \\ A^T_i\pme$.  We must show that $\t = \e_i$, $t = 0$.  Suppose that it's not.  Then we have $\t^T A = A_i$, and by \Cref{minimal_Ab_pair_properties} $\ip{\t}{-\b} < b_i$.  Since $-t \leq 0$, $\ip{\t}{-\b} - t < b_i$, a contradiction.  So we have shown that $\t = \e_i$, in which case $t = 0$, and the proposition follows.
\end{proof}

Suppose that we have a $(U,V)$ and $(A,\b)$ such that $P_{UV} = \VP{U}{V} = \HP{A}{\b}$, and $(A,\b)$ is an minimal pair.  We run our program and get a new pair $(A',\b')$.  Denote $P_{A',\b'} := \HP{A'}{\b'}$.  We would like to verify that $P_{UV} = P_{A',\b'}$.  We have the following:
\begin{alignat*}{2}
	 & A'U\leq\0,\, A'V\leq\b'     & \;\Rightarrow\; & P_{UV} \subseteq P_{A',\b'} \\
	 & (A,\b) \sqsubseteq (A',\b') & \;\Rightarrow\; & P_{A',\b'} \subseteq P_{UV} \\
	 & P_{UV} = P_{A',\b'}         & \;\Rightarrow\; & A'U\leq\0,\, A'V\leq\b'     \\
	 & P_{UV} = P_{A',\b'}         & \;\Rightarrow\; & (A,\b) \sqsubseteq (A',\b')
\end{alignat*}
The last line uses \Cref{minimal_Ab}.  So we conclude:

\begin{EqCriteria}\label{eq_vp_hp}
	Suppose that there is an minimal pair $(A,\b)$ such that $P_{UV} = \VP{U}{V} = \HP{A}{b}$.  Then the following are equivalent:
	\[ P_{UV} = \HP{A'}{\b'} \Leftrightarrow A'U\leq\0,\,A'V\leq\b',\,(A,\b)\sqsubseteq (A',\b') \]
\end{EqCriteria}

\begin{Test}[V-Polyhedron $\to$ H-Polyhedron]\label{test_vp_to_hp}
	We now have a method for testing the program.  First, we hand-craft a V-Polyhedron $\VP{U}{V}$ based on some minimal pair $(A,\b)$, then run our program to get the pair $(A',\b')$, with the alleged property that $\VP{U}{V} = \HP{A'}{\b'}$.  If we confirm \Cref{eq_vp_hp}, then our program has succeeded.
