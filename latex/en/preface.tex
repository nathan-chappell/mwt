Polyhedra are fundamental mathematical objects.  Two ways of describing polyhedra are:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A finite intersection of half-spaces
  \item The \textit{Minkowski-Sum} of the \textit{convex-hull} of a finite set of rays and a finite set of points
\end{enumerate}
The \MWT is a fundamental result in the theory of polyhedra.  It states that both means of representation are equivalent.  The proof given here is algorithmic in nature, using a technique known as \textit{Fourier-Motzkin elimination}.  The algorithm implied by the proof is then implemented in C++.
