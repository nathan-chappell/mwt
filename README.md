# README.md

# Overview
This repository contains the files relevant to my work on a proof of the Minkowski-Weyl Theorem (MWT), and C++ (cpp) code relevant to an enumeration algorithm.

## Latex
* mwt.tex            - the proof

## cpp (src,include)
* common.{cpp,h}            Types, IO, and Fourier Motzkin elimination.
* hcone.{cpp,h}             Functions to transform H-Cone $to$ V-Cone.
* polyhedra.{cpp,h}         Transforms between polytopes and polyhedra.
* vcone.{cpp,h}             Functions to transform V-Cone $to$ H-Cone.

# Executable programs
* vcone_to_hcone
* vpoly_to_hpoly
* hcone_to_vcone
* hpoly_to_vpoly
