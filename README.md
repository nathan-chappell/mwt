# README.md

# Overview
This repository contains the files relevant to my work on a proof of the Minkowski-Weyl Theorem (MWT), and C++ (cpp) code relevant to an enumeration algorithm.

## Latex
The paper is written in latex, and all latex files are contained in this folder.  It is broken up into different .tex files, and this organization will probably change or be elaborated as the paper comes closer to completion.  Currently, the files currently include:
* definitions.tex   - here are the \newcommands I'm using
* proof_diagram.tex - here is the tikz image of the diagram I'm using to guide the proof
* mwt.tex           - the main file (needs more organization)

## cpp
Hopefully I'll put something in here later tonight
